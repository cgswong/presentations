# Configuration Management and Service Discovery

* **Configuration Management tools tend to focus on "pets"**
  - configuration we already know and want to control over time
    - versions of packages and applications
    - user permissions
    - security settings
    - system state

* **Service Discovery tools handle _*emergent*_ configuration**
  - properties of running systems
    - load balancer and proxy back-ends
    - network and firewall routes
